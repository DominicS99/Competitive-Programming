# Competitive-Programming

A list of CP problems I've solved over various sites. I started around January 2022 and I've learned a lot by doing this. Assume that most of these aren't the most efficient ways to solve these problems, but they passed all test cases.

Almost all of my coding is done in C++ as of November 15, 2022, so expect to find those kinds of solutions in this repo.
